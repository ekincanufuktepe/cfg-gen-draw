# cfg-gen-draw
Control-Flow Graph (CFG) Generator and Drawer

I have used CFGs a lot in my studies. Therefore, I wrote a very simple Java code that generates every method's CFG of a given Java software. The CFG generation is powered with Soot. Then these CFG's are generated in ".dot" format. Then these dot files parsed by a program called Graphviz and each CFG is visualized with any image format you desire.

Basically the tool is just for generating CFGs and visualizing them.
